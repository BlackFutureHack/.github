# Welcome to the Black Future Hack 👩🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻👨🏿‍💻

The Black Future Hack is a unique two-day hackathon, organised as a collaboration between [Frocentric](https://tech.frocentric.io) and [Coding Black Females](https://codingblackfemales.com). As a closing event for Black History Month, we'll be uniting Black tech practitioners and domain experts to develop innovative solutions for real-world challenges facing Black British citizens across the UK.

Our mission is to facilitate the creation of viable applications that can ultimately deliver tangible benefits to our communities.

## What are we hacking on?

Teams will have the opportunity to tackle identified problems in the following core themes:

### Education

Empirical evidence has shown that Black heritage pupils lag far behind the average achievement of many of their peers. A recent analysis by the Guardian found that children from minority backgrounds are subjected to ‘incredible injustices’, with Black Caribbean pupils being excluded from schools over 6x more frequently than their white peers in parts of the country.

Entrants can explore solutions addressing primary, secondary, college, university, private, supplementary or home-schooling education pathways.

### Wellness


Black people suffer from a wide range of negative impacts on their wellness, including the lowest rates of mental health treatment despite higher prevalence of problems, disproportionate rates of detention under the Mental Health Act, higher mortality rates during pregnancy/childbirth and from Covid-19 and many other unfavourable metrics.

Participants will be able to investigate solutions relating to diet, fitness, mental health, reproductive health, access to services, etc.


### Financial Literacy

There are several socio-economic headwinds that impact Black citizens, including below-average income levels, higher levels of unemployment and household debt, plus significantly lower household wealth and home ownership.

Collaborators can develop solutions for savings, market trading, asset investment, debt management and financial planning.

## When is the event?

The inaugural, in-person event is scheduled for 28-30 October, 2022
